## Installation
```shell
npm i
```

## Usage
To execute these tests, simply run:

```shell
npm test
```

## Credits
These tests excute against the [Google Task API][api] and would not provide much value without it existing as a sample API. They use the [Chakram][chakram] library and run under the [mocha][mocha] test framework.
